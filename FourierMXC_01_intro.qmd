# Non-technical description of Fourier transform

Imagine that you have a website where you sell widgets. If we display the time
of the purchases we could see they happen more often during the evening, close
to the weekends. Thus, there are two repeating or rhythmic patterns, one
following the day night cycle and one following a weekly cycle.

We could display the amount of purchases as a function of time, or it also 
could be insightful to look at the data based on the interval ($x$ axis) and
the strength of the cyclic behavior ($y$ axis). The first case is called the
time domain, whereas the second is called the frequency domain, based on the
variable displayed on the $x$ axis.

If you are interested in understanding the rhythmicity of a system and you
use the Fourier transform to extract those rhythmic components out of a
signal (spectral analysis).
This is particularly useful for systems that have rhythmicity at multiple
time scales, or when the data are noisy because the Fourier transform can
sometimes isolate different features of the signal and therefore separate
the signal from noise.

A second use of the Fourier transform is as a tool in signal processing
and data analysis. In this case, you're not interested in the results of
the Fourier transform per se. However, many signal processing methods
(convolution, filtering, compression) can be implemented in more efficient
ways through the use of the frequency domain. I instead of directly processing
the data on the time domain, you would apply the Fourier transform, perform
the required operations on the frequency domain, and then apply the inverse
Fourier transform to get back into the time domain (convolution theorem).
This concept appears counterintuitive at first because it seems like this
method involves more steps. However, these steps can be performed in a
extremely efficient way thanks to the fast Fourier transform algorithm.

## How does the Fourier transform work?

The point here is that understanding how the Fourier transform works is
important, even if you are not fundamentally interested in understanding
rhythmicity in systems.

See the explanation on `sigprocMXC_02_spectral.qmd` (it was redacted first).

# Examples of Fourier transform applications

You are not expected to understand this code now.
The point is simply to marvel at the strange beauty of the Fourier transform.

```{python}
import copy
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.gridspec as gridspec
import matplotlib.image as im
from scipy.interpolate import CubicSpline

# 1D Examples
srate = 1000
time  = np.arange(0, 2, 1/srate)
n     = len(time)
hz    = np.linspace(0, srate, n)

def plot1d(amp, time=time, hz=hz):

    # Declare the figure
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 1) # , figsize=(7.5, 1 * count)

    # Plot on the time domain
    axes[0].plot(time, amp)
    axes[0].set_xlim(time[[0,-1]])
    axes[0].set_xlabel('Time (sec.)')

    # Plot on the frequency
    psd = 2 * np.abs(np.fft.fft(amp)/n)
    axes[1].plot(hz, psd,'-')
    axes[1].set_xlim([0,100])
    axes[1].set_xlabel('Frequency (Hz)')

    fig.supylabel('Amplitude')
    fig.tight_layout();
```

We start by initializing some parameters for the simulations: the frequency
is $1000$ Hz with a length of 2 seconds. Then we plot the signals in the time
domain and in the frequency domain

A sine wave with a frequency of 5 Hz (5 cycles per second) and a frequency of 1.
In the frequency domain there is a single spike at 5 Hz.

```{python}
plot1d(np.sin(2*np.pi*5*time))
```

For the multispectral case we added three sine waves with different frequencies
(2, 7, 14) and amplitudes (2, 3, 6), which is reflected by the frequency domain
plot.

```{python}
plot1d(
    2 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * 5 * time) +
    3 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * 7 * time) +
    6 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * 14 * time)
    )
```

White noise it's just random numbers in both the time and frequency domains.
There may be some peaks, but then again, it is just noise.

```{python}
plot1d(np.random.randn(n))
```

Brownian noise is a different kind of noise, a different color of noise
(sometimes called pink noise). It is just the integral, the cumulative sum
of random noise. In the frequency domain, it looks like an exponential decay,
a shape stemming from the nature of this time series.

```{python}
plot1d(np.cumsum(np.random.randn(n)))
```

$1/f$ noise has a similar behavior to brownian noise, showing a gentle decay
on the amplitude spectrum.

```{python}
ps = ( # Make the signal on the frequency domain, bring to the time domain
    np.exp(1j * 2 * np.pi * np.random.rand(int(n/2))) *
    .1 + np.exp(-(np.arange(int(n/2)))/50)
    )
plot1d(np.real(np.fft.ifft(np.concatenate((ps,ps[::-1])))) * n)
```

A square wave pulse looks like a bunch of these kind of time-limited plateaus
that repeat at regular intervals. In the frequency domain it goes down with
increasing frequency, but seems to bounce several times afterwards. In fact,
the rate of this bouncing turns out to be related to the duration of these
plateaus. If we change the threshold from $0.9$ to $0.7$ it changes the
frequency response. Changing the frequency of the sine wave that's
being thresholded also would change the shape of the spectrum.

```{python}
square = np.zeros(n)
square[np.sin(2 * np.pi * 3 * time) > .9] = 1
plot1d(square)
```

An amplitude modulated signal (A.M. signal, the same as in the radio) is a
pure sine wave at 40 hertz with amplitude modulations over time. Because the
signal has amplitude changes over time (non-stationarities), the peak in
frequency domain becomes wider with energy at frequencies we did not specify.
This pertains to non-stationarities and signals, and the effects.

```{python}
cubic = CubicSpline(np.linspace(1,10,10), np.random.rand(10))
plot1d(10 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * 40 * time) * cubic(np.linspace(1, 10, n)))
```

On a frequency modulated signal (f.M. signal, the same as in the radio), the
amplitude is fixes but there are frequency is changes. On the frequency domain
it has a broader 'hill', rather than the peak shown for an AM signal.

```{python}
linear = np.interp(
    x=np.linspace(1, 10, n),
    xp=np.linspace(1,10,10),
    fp=np.random.rand(10)
    )
freqmod = 20 * linear
plot1d(np.sin(2 * np.pi * ((10 * time + np.cumsum(freqmod))/srate)))
```

Filtered noise also creates a signal that changes in its dynamics and its
characteristics over time (non-stationary): both amplitude and frequency
change over time.

```{python}
signal = np.random.randn(n)          # start with noise
s  = 5 * (2 * np.pi - 1)/(4 * np.pi) # normalized width
fx = np.exp(-.5 * ((hz - 10)/s)**2)  # gaussian
fx /= np.max(fx)                     # gain-normalize
plot1d(20*np.real( np.fft.ifft( np.fft.fft(signal)**fx) ))
```

## 2D signals

```{python}
def plot2d(img):

    # power and phase spectra
    img_x = np.fft.fftshift(np.fft.fft2(img))
    power = np.log(np.abs(img_x))
    phase = np.angle(img_x)

    ## show the results!
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, sharex=True, sharey=True, figsize=(8,8))
    titles = ['Space domain', 'Amplitude spectrum', 'Phase spectrum']
    for ax_idx, array in enumerate((img, power, phase)):
        axes[ax_idx].imshow(array)
        axes[ax_idx].set_title(titles[ax_idx])
    fig.tight_layout()
```

A GÃ¡bor patch, it's like a spatial sine wave, plus a Gaussian. On the space
domain plot you can notice there is a sinusoidal pattern going from the top
left to the bottom right. It is also darker around the center and then gets
lighter around the edges. On the amplitude and the phase spectrums, you can
see that interpreting the fourier transform of an image is more complex than
a one-dimensional time series.

```{python}
# gabor patch
width = 20      # width of gaussian
sphs  = np.pi/4 # sine phase
lims = np.arange(-91,92)
y,x  = np.meshgrid(lims,lims)
xp   = x*np.cos(sphs) + y*np.sin(sphs)
yp   = y*np.cos(sphs) - x*np.sin(sphs)
gaus2d = np.exp(-(xp**2 + yp**2) / (2*width**2))
sine2d = np.sin( 2*np.pi*.02*xp )

plot2d(sine2d * gaus2d)
```

If we generate an image containing pure white noise the amplitude and the
phase are just noise as well.

```{python}
# white noise
plot2d(np.random.randn(183, 183))
```

Now I'm going to show you a picture that's very often used in computer science.
When you look at this amplitude, you would never guess that this is what the
picture looks like. However, all of the information that's contained in this
picture is perfectly represented by the combination of the amplitude and the
phase spectrum.

```{python}
lenna = np.mean(im.imread('FourierMXC_01_intro/Lenna.png'),axis=2)
plot2d(lenna)
```

We can apply a low pass filter to the data by applying a gaussian to the
frequency domain representation, and then reconstruct the image using the
inverse fourier transform. Now the image has become blurry. Conversely, a 
high pass filter highlights the high frequency features of the image,
the edges, which can be useful to determine the edges of the objects.

poo

```{python}
# ### low-pass filtered Lenna
width = .1    # 
meshx = np.linspace(-2,2, lenna.shape[0])
y,x   = np.meshgrid(meshx, meshx)

imgX  = np.fft.fftshift(np.fft.fft2(lenna))
kernels = [
    np.exp(-(x**2 + y**2) / (2* .1**2)), # .1 width of gaussian (normalized Z units)
    1 - np.exp(-(x**2 + y**2) / (2 * .3**2)) # .3
]
for k in kernels:
    plot2d(np.real(np.fft.ifft2(np.fft.fftshift(imgX * k))))
```

If we translate an image to the frequency domain, scramble the phase, and bring
it back to the space domain it looks nothing alike the original image. This
just shows how important the phase spectrum is for a time series and for, an
image.

```{python}
# ## phase-scrambled Lenna
powr2  = np.abs(imgX)
phas2  = np.angle(imgX)
ridx   = np.random.choice(len(phas2)**2,size=len(phas2)**2) # randomization index
rphas2 = np.reshape(phas2[np.unravel_index(ridx,phas2.shape)],phas2.shape) # random phases
plot2d(np.real(np.fft.ifft2(np.fft.fftshift(powr2*np.exp(1j*rphas2)))))
```
